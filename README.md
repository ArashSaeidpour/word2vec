# Implementation of word2vec on Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) dataset
“You shall know a word by the company it keeps” (J. R. Firth)
## Introduction
This repository contains a step by step guide on implementation of word2vec skipgram on Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) dataset, and is the solution to coding sections of [Assignment #2](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a2.pdf) of Stanford's ["CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning"](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) course. Contents of this notebook are taken from the course materials. <br>
I recommend reading the original papers [1,2] and all the course materials on the word2vec (specially this [one]( http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/readings/cs224n-2019-notes01-wordvecs1.pdf) before proceeding to implementation. But if you are looking a for a shortcut, the [this link](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/) covers all the major points in both papers.
